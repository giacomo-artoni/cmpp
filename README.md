# Computation Methods for Particle Physicists
Notebooks and examples for Computational Methods in Particle Physics

These are the notebooks that go along with a series of lectures initially developed by Matthew Bass to introduce Particle Physicists to computational methods they will likely find useful in their research careers. This is a an updated version for the 2021 lectures.

There are four lectures in total, each one has a dedicated folder where the lecture slides and the associated notebooks can be found:

1. Introductory Lecture
  * Matplotlib Example.ipynb
  * NumPy Examples.ipynb
  * Pandas Tests.ipynb
2. Bayesian Inference
  * Bayesian Inference 0.ipynb
  * Bayesian Inference 1.ipynb
3. Classification Problems
  * Classification -1 Easy classify.ipynb
  * Classification 1.ipynb
  * Classification MiniBooNE.ipynb
  * TMVAClassification.C
  * TMVAImportDataAndClean.py
4. Neural Networks
  * NeuralNetworks (folder)
